## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### My Interpretation of the Challenge

I am using this challenge to practice the concept of Context API studied in the Udemy course. We are replacing the App.jsx' state & removing prop drilling by having Product Context Provider & Cart Context Provider which are consumed by different components.

### Deviations from OG Design & Acceptance Criteria

1. On mobile view, change the order of cart to be first on the screen & the grid to be second. I found that grid stacked in 1 col results in the long scroll (especially since I've added a few more items - see the point below), and the distance between adding an item and having to scroll so faw below to see it added to the cart is quite jarring. Similar problem exists in desktop view where the cart is a sidebar but not fixed (or its simply not stated its fixed positioned?) and when the grid gets large, the scroll is significant. I mention some potential solutions in the Continuous Dev section 

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### Continued development

There are a few solutions I'd like to implement to improve long grid scroll/cart position:
- adding a 'Back to top' btn when scrolling product grid, as well as scrolling to the top/cart position every time an item gets added.
- making cart fixed either at sidebar or header position to always be visible
- (personal favourite): making a little sidebar initially hidden, then opening into view (aka shelf, sliding) on desktop, and serving as a burger menu/nav on mobile to free up space on both layouts. The cart icon to be only displaying the quantity of items added and on clicking, slide open the full cart view (a la Amazon and every other e commerce site).

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
